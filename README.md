## üëãüèª Hello!

I am known on the internet as Threebow, and this is my GitHub profile. Programming has been a significant part of my life for as long as I can remember. I enjoy starting and being actively engaged in multiple projects and ventures simultaneously, as it presents a satisfying challenge. Here is a brief summary of my current development work as well as some past achievements.

### Currently Focused On:
- [Arion Studios](https://arionstudios.com): My freelance agency, offering a range of digital solutions.
- [Nebulosity](https://nebulosity.digital): My venture agency with a focus on cryptocurrency projects.
- [TSManage](https://demo.tsmanage.com): A long-standing SaaS platform that streamlines TeamSpeak management processes for FiveM communities.
- [0xWRLD](https://x.com/0xWRLD): A browser-based blockchain game deeply integrates with NFTs across several connected wallets simultaneously.

### Preferred Programming Languages:
- TypeScript
- Lua
- Pug
- SCSS
- Solidity

I am proudly a maximalist of the Node + TypeScript ecosystem. Despite my experience with a variety of programming languages, my preference and enjoyment for Node and TypeScript are unmatched, making them my personal choices for most projects. While I have occasionally used Rust and Go, I must admit they are not among my favorites.

### Areas of Interest:
- MVC-style applications
- Heavily data-driven applications (e.g. data lakes)
- Game development (I integrated Vue 3 within GameMaker for 100% of [0xWRLD](https://x.com/0xWRLD)'s UI)
- Networking-intensive applications (e.g. game servers)
- Distributed systems
- Blockchain applications (e.g. EVM, Solana)
- Vue

### Most Used Tools:
I like to use the following stack when it comes to distributed data-driven applications:

- Node
- Postgres
- Redis
- Kafka

### Misc.:
- In 2017, I created a [YouTube tutorial series on creating a Discord bot with Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=024upsEuHaU&list=PLVBD9pLCy6oogSgJuUQzE-99_-voOdSng). Although it's no longer current, I'd like to believe that it helped a lot of people, as evidenced by the series accumulating over 350,000 views to date. Might start creating content again, who knows.
